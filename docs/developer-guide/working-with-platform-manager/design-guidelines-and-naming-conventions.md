## Introduction

These design guidelines are intended for module development that extends and interacts with the Virto Commerce platform.

The goal of the .NET Framework design guidelines is to help library designers ensure that their users reap the benefits of API consistency and ease of use by providing a unified programming model that is independent of the programming language used for development. It is strongly recommended that you follow these design guidelines when developing classes and components that extend the .NET Framework. Inconsistent library design adversely affects developer productivity and discourages adoption.

Extensibility is the ability to add or modify the behavior of objects.
