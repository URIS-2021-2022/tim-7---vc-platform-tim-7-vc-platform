Filters are simple methods that modify the output of numbers, strings, variables and objects. They are placed within an output tag **&lcub;&lcub;** **&rcub;&rcub;** and are separated with a pipe character **|**.

{% raw %}
```
<-- product.title = "Sample Product Title" -->

{{ product.title | upcase }}

Output: SAMPLE PRODUCT TITLE
```
{% endraw %}

In the example above, **product** is the object, **title** is its attribute, and **upcase** is the filter being applied.

Some filters require a parameter to be passed.

{% raw %}
```
<-- product.title = "Sample Product Title" -->

{{ product.title | remove: "Sample" }}

Output: Product Title
```
{% endraw %}

Multiple filters can be used on the output. They are applied from left to right.

{% raw %}
```
<-- product.title = "Sample Product Title" -->

{{ product.title | upcase | remove: "SAMPLE" }}

Output: PRODUCT TITLE
```
{% endraw %}

## Creating your own filters

As a developer, you can create custom filters that then can be used by a themes designer.

Creating filters is very easy. Filters are just methods which take one parameter and return a modified string. You can use your own filters by passing an array of filter types to the Render, an example follows:

```
template.Render(filters: new[] { typeof(MyTextFilters), typeof(MyDateFilters) });

public static class TextFilter
{
  public static string Textilize(string input)
  {
    return TextileFormatter.FormatString(input);
  }
}
```

you will then need to register the filter in the Virto Commerce frontend:

```
var filters = new[] { typeof(ModelFilters), typeof(TranslationFilter), typeof(TextFilter) };
```

A filter can access the current context if you add a Context object as the first argument to your filter method. DotLiquid will automatically pass the current context to your filter:

```
public static String MyFilter(Context context, String input)
{
  ...
}
```
