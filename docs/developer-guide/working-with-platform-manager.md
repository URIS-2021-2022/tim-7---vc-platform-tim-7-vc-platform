## Virto Commerce Platform

We have isolated a clean platform constructed with full compliance with the principles of SOLID and DDD and oriented for use in Azure or IIS. It is based on the next stack of technologies:

* ASP.NET MVC (as web framework)
* ASP.NET Web API (REST-full web services)
* AngularJS (UI)
* Entity Framework with migrations (persistence layer)

The platform can be used for new module development or as a starting point for building your own application.

## Included functionality

* Single-page web application with horizontal scrolling blade-based navigation (AngularJS)
* HTML5 compatible UI theme
* Authentication and authorization (ASP.NET Identity)
* Users and roles management
* Module based extensibility
* Widget based UI extensibility
* Notifications
* Background jobs execution and scheduling (Hangfire)
* Assets management
* Application settings management
* Caching with support for cache provider extensions

## Deployment

Virto Commerce Platform can be deployed to <a class="crosslink" href="https://virtocommerce.com/ecommerce-hosting" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure cloud</a> or any other environment which has the following components installed:

* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1
