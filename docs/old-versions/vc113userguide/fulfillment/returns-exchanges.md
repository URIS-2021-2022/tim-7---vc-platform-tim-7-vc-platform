## Introduction

CSRs and warehouse staff may perform and accept returns, respectively. Returns and exchanges maximize user satisfaction and increase customer confidence and sales.

Only CSRs with required permissions can create a return or exchange. The system automatically creates a unique code, called the Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) code, for all such transactions. Typically, the RMA number is recorded on the physical return to assist warehouse employees in matching the receipt of the return to the correct customer account.

For each SKU being returned, the CSR must enter the following details:

* Quantity being returned.
* Reason for return.
* Comment.

The CSR must also specify whether the  physical return of items is required before refund can be issued

Depending on whether the customer wants a refund or an exchange, the CSR has additional steps to execute:

* Refund: The CSR must enter a refund amount to be credited to the customer.
* Exchange: The CSR must select a SKU to exchange the incoming product for.

Refunds must be credited to the purchase medium used in the original purchase. In special situations, CSRs may issue a refund to another payment source. For example, if the buyer used a now-expired credit card for the purchase, a CSR may issue the refund to another credit card.
