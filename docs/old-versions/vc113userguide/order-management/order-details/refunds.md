## Introduction

Refund is a special type of payment when money is transferred back to a buyer. Typically a refund is initiated as a consequence of an item return. It's also possible to issue a refund because of other reasons, without a return. Refund must be credited to the purchase medium used in the original purchase. In special situations, you may issue a refund to a new payment source. For example, if the buyer used a now-expired credit card for the purchase, you may issue the refund to a new credit card.
