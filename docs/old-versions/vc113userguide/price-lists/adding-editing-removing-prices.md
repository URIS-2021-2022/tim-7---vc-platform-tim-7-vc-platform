**List price** - often this is MSRP (Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price). If this is the only price list entry for the product, this price will be the default price.

**Sale price** - the price you offer this product in your store for.

**Min. Quantity** - should be at least "1".Miinimum quantity of the item that must be ordered for the List or Sale price to take effect.
