## Logging on to the Commerce Manager

1. Start the Commerce Manager.
2. Enter your user name, password, and the URL of the Commerce Manager Server. (Ask your store administrator for this information if you do not have it.)
3. Click Login.

Permissions determine which activities and functionality the user can access and what data blocks will be visible on the dashboard.

Please see the list of permissions in [Available Permissions](docs/old-versions/vc113userguide/users-management-roles-and-role-assignment/available-permissions).

## General Navigation

When a user logged on to the Virto Commerce client the first thing he can view is [Dashboard](docs/old-versions/vc113userguide/dashboard).

The dashboard reflects the state of key commerce blocks, such as orders, customers cases,  sales dynamics and other brief information you can view depending on your access rights. You can read more about dashboard blocks in [Dashboard](docs/old-versions/vc113userguide/dashboard).

Above the dashboard (just click the white arrow) the general menu is located with the access to all of the Virto Commerce modules ([Customer Service](docs/old-versions/vc113userguide/customer-service), [Orders](docs/old-versions/vc113userguide/order-management), [Catalogs](docs/old-versions/vc113userguide/merchandise-management), [Price Lists](docs/old-versions/vc113userguide/price-lists), [Marketing](docs/old-versions/vc113userguide/marketing), [Fulfillment](docs/old-versions/vc113userguide/fulfillment), [Users](docs/old-versions/vc113userguide/users-management-roles-and-role-assignment) and [Settings](docs/old-versions/vc113userguide/settings). The navigation to required module is done with a click on it.

You can also move to a certain commerce module using dashboard buttons. Just click required block. For example,  click `Active Promotions` to open Marketing block and etc.

## User Access and Roles

In Virto Commerce, the users are the ones who use the Commerce Manager client and other back-end services, such as web services. These are internal users within your organization and should not be confused with storefront customers. User accounts can be managed with the help of the Virto Commerce Manager client.

Each Commerce Manager client user has certain access permissions which are defined by their user role. These permissions allow or restrict the users' access to Commerce Manager client modules and define which activities are allowed for them, such as viewing a customer's order or adding a new product to a catalog. These permissions help to ensure, for instance, that the Merchandise Management activity is not available to users who do not have Merchandise Management related functions.

There are several user roles provided by default with each Virto Commerce installation. You can read about them in [Built-in Roles](docs/old-versions/vc113userguide/users-management-roles-and-role-assignment).
