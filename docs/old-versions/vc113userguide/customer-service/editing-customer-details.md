In this tab it is allowed to change customer details such as:

* Emails (customer can have more than one email, one of them is set as primary one and used for contact, alerts and newsletter);
* Phone (number of customer's phone);
* Addresses (customer can use different addresses for shipping);
* Tags (use them to differentiate customers, for instance "new", "vip", "partnership" and etc.);
* Language (customer's localization options);
* Time zone (time zone of a customer can be useful for email and sms newsletters);
* Birthday (also can be used for birthday newsletters and promo).

Here you can also leave an internal note (for instance, mark this customer as to make call to and etc.)
