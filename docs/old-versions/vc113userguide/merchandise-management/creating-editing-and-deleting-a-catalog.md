## Deleting a Catalog

To delete a catalog (or virtual catalog), right-click on it in catalogs tree and select "Delete" option from the context menu. A "Delete confirmation" dialog is displayed in order to confirm the action. Confirmation dialog provides additional information about the selected catalog like category count and item count:

This dialog contains an additional security field. The delete can proceed only if security field is filled in and matches the beginning of catalog name. Catalog with all related data is deleted after the action confirmed. Deleted catalog will disappear from the catalog tree.
