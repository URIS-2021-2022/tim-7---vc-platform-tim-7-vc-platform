A dynamic kit is a type of catalog item which can be dynamically configured by the customer. This configuration (or grouping) of products is based on the customer's needs and is sold as a single unit. The components of a dynamic kit are controlled through a set of predefined conditions and user interaction, and supplied at order entry time. Adding a dynamic kit to an order is similar to adding a package. Like a package, the individual components of a dynamic kit cannot be modified and the entire configuration must be fulfilled as a whole. It is allowed to change the dynamic kit components by reconfiguring it using the system.
