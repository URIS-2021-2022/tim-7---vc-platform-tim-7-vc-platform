## Creating Product Associations

Product Associations are used to show related products, accessories and other types of items for a customer when he views a product page. The administrators define which types of products will be displayed as associated with an item.

This refers to marketing policy and increasing the average check of a customers shopping cart since customers start buying similar products of a higher price or add different accessories to the selected good.

### How the associations can be used

1. **Creating cross sells and up sells.**

Cross sells offer alternative goods that are similar to the product the customer is viewing. This is the way to promote overstocked items.

**Example**: a customer viewing a TV Samsung LN32D403 can be recommended overstocked TV Samsung LN37D550.

Up sells promote similar items for a higher price, more expensive ones. These could be higher-end products.

**Example**: a customer viewing digital camera Samsung for $149.00 and can be recommended a similar but more expensive Samsung edition for $199.00.

2. **Adding accessories.**

You can promote complementary products for the goods that are currently being viewed. This approach makes shoppers add more products to their shopping carts.

**Example**: a customer viewing a bicycle can be offered special equipment, such as helmet, bike suit and bike glasses.

3. **Making replacements.**

When a customer is viewing a product and finds out it is overstocked, he can leave the shop and not add any items to his cart. In this case substitute goods are offered.

**Example**: a customer can be offered a similar model of a cell phone instead of the one that occurred to be out of stock.

### How to create product associations

Open a product in a Virto Commerce catalog and in the "Associations" tab use "Add new" button to define a new association group.
