## Introduction

Order life cycle is divided into separate distinct states. Predefined order states:

```
public enum OrderStatus
{
  Pending,
  OnHold,
  PartiallyShipped,
  InProgress,
  Completed,
  Cancelled,
  AwaitingExchange
}
```

An order is always in one of these states. (An exception to the rule is allowed only if order data were imported from external data source.) An order is considered to be in a state of **InProgress**, if exact enumeration mach wouldn't be found. When an order [is placed in front end](docs/old-versions/vc113devguide/working-with-orders/order-lifecycle/creating-an-order-in-frontend), it gets a state of **Pending**. An automated process (job) ProcessOrderStatusWork constantly searches for **Pending** orders and, if some time conditions are met, transits the order to the state of **InProgress**. All other state transitions are initiated from Commerce Manager.
