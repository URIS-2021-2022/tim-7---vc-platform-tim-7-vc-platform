## Introduction

Most of the VirtoCommerce store data is stored in a database (DB). As our platform evolves, the DB structure might change and former DB (that was created in previous versions) might get obsolete. Such DB's need to migrate. We'll publish migration scripts and list them here.

## Migrations

### From version 1.6 to 1.7:

* Execute <a href="../../assets/files/OrdersMigration_1_7.sql">this SQL script</a> on Orders (in case you have separate) database.
* Execute <a href="../../assets/files/SecurityMigration_1_7.sql">this SQL script</a> on Security (in case you have separate) database.

### From version 1.7 to 1.8:

* Execute <a href="../../assets/files/AppConfigMigration_1_8.sql">this SQL script</a> on AppConfig (in case you have separate) database.
