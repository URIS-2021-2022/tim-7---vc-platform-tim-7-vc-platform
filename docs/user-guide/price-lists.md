In the Virto Commerce Manager, a <a class="crosslink" href="https://virtocommerce.com/price-engine" target="_blank">price list</a> is a set of pricing details that can be assigned to items. All prices are stored in a price list, which is associated with a catalog and a currency. The item (SKU) code links the price in a selected price list to the item inside catalog. Moreover it is possible to configure prices for an item in it's details view directly.

When a customer views an item in the storefront, applied pricing settings are showcased as item's price.
